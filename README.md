# ðŸ¤– PID Auto-Balancer

This project demonstrates a real-time PID-controlled auto-balancing system using Arduino. A cart mounted on a pivoting seesaw-style track is stabilized using ultrasonic feedback and a custom C++ PID controller.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

- Developed a **feedback control system** to keep a cart balanced on a pivoting track.
- Used **ultrasonic sensors** to measure cart position and calculate error.
- Implemented a **PID algorithm in Arduino C++** to process sensor data and drive a servo motor that adjusts the track angle.
- Applied the **Ziegler-Nichols tuning method** for optimal PID performance.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Real-time control with responsive balancing
- Simple and reproducible mechanical setup
- Clean, modular C++ code with PID logic
- Achieved stable rebalancing within **~0.5 seconds**
